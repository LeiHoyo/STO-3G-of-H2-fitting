# STO-3G-of-H2-fitting-
Learing a minimal basis set for the hydrogen molecule can help us better understand the concept of basis sets
This Notebook is guided by [Weiliang Luo](https://bohrium.dp.tech/user/luowl)'s Notebook [Re: Starting from Scratch in the e-World (I) HF Approximation, STO-3G Basis Set, and SCF Calculation](https://bohrium.dp.tech/notebooks/76266786918).
Theoretical and algorithmic aspects mainly refer to the following classic textbook:
"Attila Szabo, Neil S. Ostlund. Modern Quantum Chemistry. Dover Publications, Inc., 1996."
